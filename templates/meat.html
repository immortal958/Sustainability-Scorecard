		<h2>The carbon footprint of
            meat: how meat-lovers
            can do their bit</h2><br>
		<h4>Mark mcCafferty</h4>
        <p>The carbon footprint of meat has become a hot
            topic. The suggestion being that meat is bad
            and we should be giving it up in the fight against
            climate change. While it's true the carbon
            footprint of meat is higher, there is a middle
            ground and meat-lovers can absolutely do their
            bit. So don't fret if you don't want to go as far as
            vegetarian or vegan, there is still plenty you can
            do.
            </p><br>
        <p>Let's look at some numbers for meat, and how
            they compare to other foods..
            </p>    

		<h4>C02e, or carbon dioxide equivalent, is the
            measure of all greenhouse gas emissions
            rolled into one
            </h4>
		<p>The data is pretty clear when comparing local
            meat and veg. Beef is particularly high due tothe energy required to raise cows, and made
            worse by their methane burps as they chew the
            cud (this gas is 25 times more potent than CO2).
            So reducing the amount of beef and other
            meats in your diet makes a difference.
            </p>

		<h4>It doesn't have to be all or nothing
            with meat
            </h4>
		<p>The good news is that meat-lovers don't have to
            give up meat to do their bit. It's about making
            small changes to your usual diet. Sensible
            reductions of meat in the average UK diet could
            cut your food carbon footprint by up to 25%.
            </p>
        <h4>For example, if you went plant-based for just
            two lunches and two dinners a week, you could
            save approximately 280 kg CO2e over a year.
            That's the equivalent of a return flight from
            Glasgow to London!
            </h4>
            <p>The trend is already happening with 'flexitarian'
                diets on the rise in the UK. And with this trend
                comes a host of new veggie recipes and meat-
                free alternatives to try.</p>
