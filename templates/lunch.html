		<p>Lunch - the no man's land between breakfast
            and dinner. Arguably the trickiest of the meal
            trinity, lunch can be a hard one to get right,
            particularly if you're back on the commute and
            reluctant to splash out millions on a daily Pret.
            There's also the environmental impact of our
            diet to consider. Food, and what you pack it in, is
            an area where small changes can make a
            massive difference to your carbon footprint.lifting to transform that midday madness into a
            moment for mindfulness. Here are a few of our
            favourite plant-based lunch options that'll carry
            you through the workday in fine form.

		<h2>The Circus Gardener
        </h2>
		<p>The Circus Gardener is run by Worcester-based
            food blogger Steve, who develops seasonal
            vegan and vegetarian recipes - usually from his
            own home-grown produce, no less - and serves
            it up with a side of food politics.
            When we reached out to Steve, he was kind
            enough to recommend a dish for this blog.'This
            is a great lunchtime meal because it is quick -
            less than 15 minutes from start to finish - and,
            more importantly, delicious. I used "yellow
            zucchini" courgettes, a variety I grow in my
            garden, helping to cut out air miles too.' We
            heart Steve.</p>
